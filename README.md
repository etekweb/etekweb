### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ethan Matzdorf. I am a Michigan Tech alum in Computer Science, and am currently working as a senior developer at [24G](https://24g.com) / [CLUTCH Experiential](https://www.clutchexperiential.com/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently most focused on projects for work, plus occasional side projects and open-source contribution on my GitHub.
- ðŸ§  I primarily work in TypeScript, with Vue.js for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend.
- ðŸ“« Best way to reach me would be over email (linked on my GitHub profile).

For more info about me and my projects, [visit my website](https://etekweb.net).
