### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ethan Matzdorf. I am a Michigan Tech alum in Computer Science, and am currently working as a developer at [24G](https://24g.com) / [CLUTCH Experiential]((https://www.clutchexperiential.com/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently most focused on projects for work, plus occasional side projects and open-source contribution on my GitHub.
- ðŸ§  Much of my recent work has been in Vue.js with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I am also familiar with Java, C, Node.js, and MySQL.
- ðŸ“« Best way to reach me would be over email (linked on my GitHub profile).
