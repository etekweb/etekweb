### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ethan Matzdorf. I am a third-year Computer Science student at Michigan Tech University.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently most focused on projects for school and work, plus occasional side projects on my GitHub.
- ðŸ§  Much of my recent work has been in Vue.js with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I am also familiar with Java, Node.js, and MySQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter/Dart for cross-platform app development.
- ðŸ“« Best way to reach me would be over email (linked on my GitHub profile).

For more info about me and my projects, [visit my website](https://etekweb.net).
